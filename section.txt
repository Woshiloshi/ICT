SECTION 1 — THE MASTER KEYS (The Non-Negotiable Truths)Markets are manipulated by smart money to raid retail liquidity — 100% of the time.  
Price does NOT move randomly — it is delivered via the Interbank Price Delivery Algorithm (IPDA).  
Time is more important than price.  
All assets (forex, indices, crypto, futures) share the exact same DNA.  
Retail indicators (RSI, MACD, Bollinger, etc.) are weapons used against you.  
If you pay for any “ICT course” you have already lost.  
Preservation of capital is priority #1. Everything else is secondary.

SECTION 2 — IPDA CYCLE & POWER OF 3 (The Only Cycle That Exists)Accumulation → Manipulation → Distribution (AMD) — repeats every single day  
Asian Session = Accumulation (range building)  
London Session = Manipulation (liquidity engineering)  
New York Session = Distribution (true directional move)

SECTION 3 — MARKET STRUCTURE (The Fractal Skeleton)Higher Timeframe Bias first (Weekly → Daily → 4H)  
Break of Structure (BOS) = continuation  
Change of Character (CHOCH / MSS) = reversal  
Internal vs External liquidity  
Displacement = smart money has entered (large candle + expansion)

SECTION 4 — PD-ARRAYS (The Only Levels That Matter)Order Block (OB) — last opposing candle before displacement  
Breaker Block — failed order block  
Mitigation Block — partial fill of OB  
Fair Value Gap (FVG) — 3-candle imbalance  
Optimal Trade Entry (OTE) — 62%–79% Fib retracement of displacement  
Liquidity Pools / Voids — equal highs & lows (stop hunts)  
Inducement — fake move to raid stops before true move
